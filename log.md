# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've set up everything to start right away.

**Thoughts** I've tried to finish so many projects and never succeeded. Maybe this challenge will help me finally finish a project :)

2. [First App](https://github.com/alain-sarti/letmesleepalarm)

### Day 2: December 31th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: The App can show a notification, but I can't play an Alarm sound. Have to investigate why that is.

**Thoughts** Showing local notifications is really a lot easier than I thought it would be ;)

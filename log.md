# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've set up everything to start right away.

**Thoughts** I've tried to finish so many projects and never succeeded. Maybe this challenge will help me finally finish a project :)

2. [First App](https://github.com/alain-sarti/letmesleepalarm)

### Day 2: December 31th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: The App can show a notification, and it can also play a sound. Need to add a way to stop it tomorrow ;)

**Thoughts** Showing local notifications is really a lot easier than I thought it would be ;)

### Day 3: January 1st, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: It took a little bit longer to be able to stop the alarm sound. But I got it fixed, a Singleton Pattern for access to the Ringtone was the answer.

**Thoughts** I definately need to structure the app way better. But I like the approach so far, to build it in stages.

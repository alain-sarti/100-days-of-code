# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've set up everything to start right away.

**Thoughts** I've tried to finish so many projects and never succeeded. Maybe this challenge will help me finally finish a project :)

2. [First App](https://github.com/alain-sarti/letmesleepalarm)

### Day 2: December 31th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: The App can show a notification, and it can also play a sound. Need to add a way to stop it tomorrow ;)

**Thoughts** Showing local notifications is really a lot easier than I thought it would be ;)

### Day 3: January 1st, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: It took a little bit longer to be able to stop the alarm sound. But I got it fixed, a Singleton Pattern for access to the Ringtone was the answer.

**Thoughts** I definately need to structure the app way better. But I like the approach so far, to build it in stages.

### Day 4: January 2nd, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I did a lot of trial and error today. But I finally got what I wanted to work. The app will now start it's stop activity even if the device is locked. Tomorrow I'll add the function of closing the activity after stopping the alarm.

**Thoughts** Sometimes things can be really easy ... if you knew what to lock for ;)

### Day 5: January 3rd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Allright, ready for the first night test. Added the input fields. Stoping the Alarm also closes the activity. The alarm also plays if the phone is set to vibrate.

**Thoughts** It's sometimes rather scary, what you can do with your app like declaring the sound you play to be an alarm and therefore ignoring the user's settings.

### Day 6: January 4th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I was woken up by my app :) Today was a slow day, I therefore started the second app, but there is nothing really to see, yet.

**Thoughts** Tomorrow will be my day off for the week.

### Day 7: January 5th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Change of plans, my day off will be tomorrow. Today, I added I18n to both apps. I will add a blog entry for the ionic 2 part, because the instructions you find in the web are mostly outdated.

**Thoughts** I can't wait for ionic 2 to become stable ...

### Day 8: January 7th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I added the display of a notification to show the intended alarm time. But I couldn't quite figure out how to cancel the alarm on a click on the notification. Maybe it's the time ;)

**Thoughts** I will have to look how an alarm app can distinguish between different alarms and shut them down ...

### Day 9: January 9th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Added the cancellation feature on notification click. I also wrote a little blog post entry for ionic 2 I18n support.

**Thoughts** I'm getting used to coding everyday. Let's see how long that will last :D

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Helper Droid App. But nothing substantial, just some progress.

### Day 12: January 12th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Helper Droid App. Pouch DB support is here and the initiative tracker functionality.

**Thoughts** being sick sucks :/

### Day 13: January 13th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Helper Droid App. But very few steps done ... went to work and I'm still sick, so feeling a bit under the weather ...

### Day 14: January 14th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Helper Droid App. The settings are done for now. I added a messages provider, but have to fill it out more.

**Thoughts** being sick sucks :/ (although I'm mostly over it now)

### Day 15: January 15th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Helper Droid App. The damage tracker part is finished. I have to think about new features to add to the app ;) Or maybe I should finally add some tests.

**Thoughts** this cold I'm having is rather persistent. But hey, a little bit of coding doesn't hurt too much, now does it ;)

### Day 16: January 16th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today there is only an intermediate state. I tried different things out regarding unit tests. But a lot of those didn't work out, so nothing much to show.

**Thoughts** Preparing the unit tests is not that easy ...

### Day 17: January 17th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finished the first test and I understand the procedure now. The problem is: that test is just superficial. I need to mock the hell out of everything. Which sucks.

**Thoughts** Mocking is super strong, but you have to wrap your head around it.

### Day 18: January 18th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Translationpipe is working for the tests. But I still need to figure out how to test a value which is set in a function calling a promise but not returning a promise itself.

**Thoughts** Promises are the bane of my thinking. Right up to the point where they work and after that it's a blast :D

### Day 19: January 20th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Changed a bit of the code and got all the necessary tests working for the settings page. Now I need to dive more into mocking and end2end testing.

**Thoughts** Testing is just so immensely powerful, but also sometimes cumbersome. Especially for a small project like this one. And after last night's rpg session, I have a new idea for another RPG companion app ;)

### Day 20: January 21st, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: End2End testing implemented. At least in theory (the end2end tests are working, but I don't have enough / all test cases, yet).

**Thoughts** End2End tests were quite easy to implement. I now have to dive deeper into protractor and it's capabilities.

### Day 21: January 22nd, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I added more e2e tests. I had to read up on protractor more. That's quite the powerful tool!

**Thoughts** I now see the merrits of tdd ;)

### Day 22: January 23rd, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started another rpg related project: 13th Age Helper Daemon. I'm playing a chaos mage and always using the books is quite the hassle. So I'm starting a little app to help me organize around that. And this time, I start with the tests ;)

**Thoughts** Protractor and ionic 2 need to be closer integrated. For example the finde by.binding doesn't work :/

### Day 23: January 24th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: The test setup for the new app is ready and I also started a test, but I cannot run any unit tests anymore. I raised an issue with the original author, so not too much progress for today.

### Day 24: January 25th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I have no progress to show since I put together my talk at a local meetup. But I want to explore that more in the future and I think it should be part of this code challenge.

### Day 27: January 29th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Progress on the chaos mage. One test isn't working though and I'm not sure why that is.

**Thoughts** The failing test could be a faulty logic, but the logic seems to work fine. Very strange indeed ...

### Day 28: January 30th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: The faulty test is no result of faulty logic, I checked that in the app. Still don't know why the test fails. Added a little bit more logic.

**Thoughts** confused ^_^

### Day 29: January 31st, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the faulty test (if you want the spied on function to do it's job, you HAVE to add .and.callThrough()). Added more tests and therefore more functionality.

**Thoughts** Happy ;)

### Day 30: February 1st, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Added more tests. I decided to add spells via json files. Will try to add this feature.

**Thoughts** I added a HttpMock class. Wondering, why no one else wanted that ...

### Day 38: February 11th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Tweaked the config files and deployed the 13th age Helper Daemon on my iPad. And to get started in something completely new, I began to learn Erlang ^_^

**Thoughts** Erlang was not on my radar of things to learn for a long time, but now I feel I need to learn a paradigm shift.
